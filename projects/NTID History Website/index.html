            <p>
                You may not know it, but every NTID student owes his/her/their education to the events of this date. On
                this date,
                the National Technical Institute for the Deaf became reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all began in the early 60's. Lyndon Baines Johnson was President of the United States. The RIT campus
                in Henrietta had
                not yet been built. (RIT was still in downtown Rochester.) Eighty percent of the jobs held by
                Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing (D/HoH) were
                manual labor.
            </p>
            <p>
                President Johnson understood the need for D/HoH men and women to obtain a higher education without
                barriers. To that end,
                Representative Hugh Carey of New York brought Public Law 89-36 to the floor of the House of
                Representatives. The bill passed
                unanimously. Senator Lister Hill (Alabama) then brought the bill to the Senate where, again, it passed
                unanimously.

            <h2>Signing into Law</h2>

            <p>
                On June 8, 1965, President Johnson signed Public Law 89-36, known as the National Technical Institute
                for the Deaf Act.
                In doing so, NTID became "real." (View Public Law 89-36)
            </p>
            <p>
                The mission of NTID has always been to prepare D/HoH students with the technical skills needed to break
                away from manual/menial labor and
                join the technical workforce on par with their hearing peers. Section 2 of PL 89-36 (The National
                Technical Instutute for the Deaf Act) reads
                as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "For the purpose of providing a residential facility for post-secondary technical training and education
                for persons who are deaf in order
                to prepare them for successful employment, there are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year
                such sums as may be necessary for the establishment and operation,
                including construction and equipment, of a National Technical Institute for the Deaf, including sums
                necessary for the acquisition of property,
                both real and personal, and for the construction of buildings and other facilities for such Institute."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The search then began for a location. In 1966, after a nationwide search and review of twenty possible
                host universities, the National Advisory Group decided upon RIT (on its new Henrietta campus) as the
                college
                with which NTID would partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Fall 1968, after years of planning, faculty recruitment, and preparing the initial facilities (the
                LBJ building had not yet been built), NTID opened its doors to its first
                class of 70 D/HoH students, offering programs in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>architectural drafting,</li>
                <li>mechanical drafting,</li>
                <li>machine tool operation,</li>
                <li>office practice, and</li>
                <li>bookeeping.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At the same time, the Student Interpreter Training Program began &mdash; the first program of its kind
                in history.
